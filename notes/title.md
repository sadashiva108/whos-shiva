Note:

Namaskar [NAMASKAR MUDRA], 
By Shiva's grace, it gives me great pleasure to share with you probably one of the most recognizable figures in all of yoga, the beloved Adiyogi Shiva. [PAUSE]

The title "Shiva's Yeshiva" of this presentation is a play on words, a Yeshiva is a Jewish educational institution not unlike a Gurukula.
