Note:

Namaskar [NAMASKAR MUDRA], 
By Shiva's grace, it gives me great pleasure to share with you probably one of the most recognizable figures in all of yoga, the beloved Shiva. 
[PAUSE]

Today we shall explore the intracacies of Shiva's nature by exploring the question:
Is Shiva a deity? A historical figure? or pure consciousness? 

I like to start out with a sublime passage from the Avadhuta Gita to give us a sense of the Shiva within each of us.

"Shiva is the soul within

I am thus the pure Shiva,
devoid of all doubt.
O beloved friend,
how shall I bow to my own Self,
in my Self?"

â€” Avadhuta Gita 3.2
