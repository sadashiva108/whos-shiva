Note:

We have learned that Shiva is a god, actually the god of gods and goddessess.

Shiva was a person in the sense that he took on a human body and operated as a great teacher to lead all to liberation regardless
of cast, sex, or race. Shiva's teachings were for anyone and transcended such limiting dualities.

Finally Shiva is a real ontological entity in evolutionary cosmology. Shiva is pure consciousness yet inseperable from his beloved shakti 
the energy that brings forth an infinitude of manifestations.

Shiva represents an ideology and philosophy as well.  We shall take a look into what Shiva's philosophy is all about in a future discourse.

Om Namah Shivaya!!
