Note:

We discussed Shiva, Shaivism, and Shaiva Tantra.
Then we explored evidence of Shaivism in Judaism as well as the Olmec Civilization.
There is much more to explore that we didn't get into today,
in particular evidence of Shaivism found in Jewish, Olmec, and Mayan etymology as well as additional similariies in their metaphysics. 

We also didn't trace the migratory patterns of the early Jews nor the Olmecs and Mayans.

Hopefully I made you all hungry for more!
