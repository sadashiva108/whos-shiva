Note:

First we may ask ourselves "Who is Shiva? Is he a deity? A historical figure? or pure consciousness?  

According to the Tantric Guru Shri Shri Anandamurtijii, Shiva's way of life was a philosophy. When one's personality becomes fully identified with one's philosophy of life one becomes a God or devata.  He is Mahadevah the god of all gods and goddesses. Why? Because every expression that emanates from the Supreme Hub(Cosmic Nucleus) is a devata.  Shiva is the aggregate of these devatas.

He is in a sense a sort of Adiyogi, who lives an ascetic life on Mount Kailash. 
He was the systematizer of the tantras around 7000 years ago.
Shiva was an embodied man in antiquity so in that sense he was a man and lived both as an
ascetic yogi or sannyasi but also lived the married life as a householder.

Shiva is Ardhanarishvara, an androgynous cosmic being, that represents the synthesis of masculine/purusha/cosmic consciousness and feminine/prakriti/shakti/energy. The image here is a visual metaphor of the deavii-shakti the two main forces responsible for all the myriads of expressions of emanates. Here Shiva is conceived of as cosmic consciousness acting as the Cognitive force along with shakti acting as the Operative force.
